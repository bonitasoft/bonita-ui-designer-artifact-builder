# pbDateTimePicker

Widget based on angular-strap date picker. 
`bs-datepicker` and `bs-timepicker` directives have been patched to fit our needs, you'll get patched code [here](https://github.com/bonitasoft/angular-strap/releases/tag/v2.3.9-patched-dateTimePicker-setValidity)

**WARNING: angular-strap-2.3.9-patched-dateTimePicker-setValidity.compat.min.js must be used to avoid collision with ui-bootstrap.js**

If you need to update angular-strap-2.3.5.compat.min.js library, be careful that all implemented tests pass otherwise you surely have broken something ;-)
